PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this application is to have a productive appointment scheduling/management
                    process. The users will log in to the application using their credentials to access the database
                    already exists. The application supplies the user with the ability to view and manuever through
                    appointments, customer and contact information, and also a variety of reports in a simple, yet
                    effective way.

DIRECTIONS TO RUN PROGRAM:
- Start the program and enter username and password. Click on submit and the application displays an alert.
Acknowledge the alert. Then from this Main Customer screen, you can select to view Customers, Reports, or you can logout
and exit the application.

Appointments View: This view allows you to either view all of the existing appointments. The user can add a new
appointment, modify an existing appointment, or delete an existing appointment. The user can also select to either view
the upcoming appointments for the week or the upcoming appointments for the month.

Customer View: This view allows the user to either view all of the customers, add a new customer, or modify and delete
an existing customer.

Reports View: This view allows the user to select from three different types of reports and view the data for each of
these reports.

CHOICE OF REPORT: The third report I chose to create is the Total Customers by Country report. This report gives the user
the ability to select a country from a combo box. Once the user selects the country, the tableview is then filled with
customers that are located in that selected country. The table also gives the information such as name, address, phone
number, etc of that customer that is also displayed in the table. To make things even more convenient there is a counter
beneath the combo box that tallies up and gives a fixed number of how many customers are in the country that was selected.
